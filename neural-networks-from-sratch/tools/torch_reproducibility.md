## Torch reproducibility parameters

1.  **`torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True`**
    *   **What it does:** This setting forces PyTorch to only use cuDNN algorithms that are deterministic. Some cuDNN operations (like certain convolution algorithms) can be non-deterministic, meaning they might produce slightly different results on the same input data across different runs, even on the same hardware. This non-determinism often arises from the order of floating-point operations, especially in parallel computations.
    *   **Why use it:** The primary reason is **reproducibility**. If you need your model training or evaluation to be *exactly* repeatable (bitwise identical results) across runs, setting this to `True` is often necessary. This is crucial for debugging, comparing model variations precisely, or meeting strict scientific standards.
    *   **Impact:** Enabling deterministic mode can sometimes come at the cost of **performance**. The deterministic algorithms might be slower than the fastest available non-deterministic ones.

2.  **`torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False`**
    *   **What it does:** This setting disables cuDNN's auto-tuner/benchmarking feature. When `benchmark = True` (which is often the default), cuDNN tries out several different algorithms for operations like convolution the first time it encounters a specific input size. It then "remembers" and uses the fastest one it found for subsequent operations with the same input size during that run.
    *   **Why use `False`:**
        *   **Reproducibility:** Even if `deterministic = True`, the benchmark mode (`True`) could potentially select *different* deterministic algorithms across runs if timing variations occur during the initial benchmark, leading to non-identical results. Setting `benchmark = False` prevents this algorithm switching based on timing, further contributing to reproducibility when used with `deterministic = True`.
        *   **Variable Input Sizes:** If your model frequently encounters inputs of different sizes (e.g., variable-length sequences in RNNs, varying image sizes), the benchmarking overhead for each new size might outweigh the benefits, potentially slowing things down overall.
    *   **Why use `True` (the default/common case):** If your input sizes are mostly fixed throughout training (common in CNNs with fixed image sizes), `benchmark = True` usually leads to **significant speedups** after the initial warmup/benchmarking phase, as cuDNN finds and uses the optimal kernels for your specific hardware and input dimensions.
    *   **Impact:** Setting to `False` ensures no algorithm switching based on benchmarking, aiding reproducibility but potentially sacrificing performance if input sizes are fixed. Setting to `True` usually improves performance for fixed input sizes but can hinder reproducibility and be slow if input sizes vary a lot.

3.  **`torch.cuda.manual_seed(42)`**
    *   **What it does:** This sets the seed for the random number generator (RNG) specifically for the **current GPU** being used by PyTorch. Any operation on the GPU that involves randomness (e.g., dropout layers, initializing weights directly on the GPU using `torch.randn(...).cuda()`) will use this seed.
    *   **Why use it:** **Reproducibility**. To ensure that the sequence of random numbers generated during GPU computations is the same every time you run the script, you need to set the seed. The number `42` is arbitrary; any fixed integer will work.
    *   **Impact:** Essential for getting reproducible results when randomness is involved in GPU operations. Note that for full reproducibility, you typically also need to set seeds for PyTorch's CPU RNG (`torch.manual_seed(42)`), Python's built-in `random` module (`random.seed(42)`), and NumPy (`np.random.seed(42)`) if you use them.

4.  **`torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = False`**
    *   **What it does:** This **completely disables** the use of the cuDNN library by PyTorch for GPU acceleration. PyTorch will fall back to its own internal implementations (or potentially other libraries if configured) for operations that cuDNN would normally handle.
    *   **Why use it:** This is **rarely** needed. Potential reasons include:
        *   Debugging: To isolate whether a bug or unexpected behavior originates from cuDNN itself.
        *   Compatibility: If there's a severe incompatibility or known bug with the installed cuDNN version for a specific operation.
        *   Extreme Reproducibility (Uncommon): As a last resort if setting `deterministic=True` and `benchmark=False` still doesn't achieve perfect reproducibility (though this usually points to other sources of randomness).
    *   **Impact:** Disabling cuDNN will almost certainly lead to a **massive decrease in performance** for most standard deep learning tasks (especially convolutions, RNNs), as cuDNN provides highly optimized implementations. This should only be used if you have a very specific reason and understand the performance implications.

**In Summary:**

*   For **maximum reproducibility**: Use `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True`, `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False`, and set all relevant random seeds (`torch.manual_seed`, `torch.cuda.manual_seed`, `np.random.seed`, `random.seed`). Be prepared for a potential performance hit.
*   For **maximum performance** (especially with fixed input sizes): Use `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True` (often the default) and potentially `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = False` (often the default). Accept that results might not be perfectly reproducible across runs.
*   Avoid `torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = False` unless you are specifically debugging cuDNN issues, as it severely impacts performance.
